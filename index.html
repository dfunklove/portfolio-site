	<p>I love to help clients bring a software project from concept to finished product.  I take pride in creating software that is easy to understand and maintain.  I do this by keeping code simple and using established technologies with a wide base of support.  I won't rest until each program is rock solid and reliable.  That's why you can rest at ease with my name on the project.</p>
	<p>I invite you to take a look at my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a> for examples of my work.</p>
	<p>Are you faced with a challenging software project?  I look forward to meeting the challenge and helping you achieve your business goals!</p>
	<!--p>I have a Bachelors degree in Software Engineering and over six years experience in the field. I love to learn, make software, and play music.</p-->
